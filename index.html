                    <h2>A coding contest like no other</h2>
                    <p>On October 13, 2024, the Vividhata Tech Club successfully hosted <small class="circle">Hackquest</small>, a dynamic online coding competition that engaged aspiring programmers in a challenging battle of data structure and algorithm (DSA) skills on the HackerRank platform. Running for 1 hour and 45 minutes, HackQuest aimed to inspire competitive programming and problem-solving through an array of carefully crafted challenges. With 60 participants joining the event’s WhatsApp group, the contest garnered significant interest, culminating in 28 signups on HackerRank. The technical team curated five unique questions, from "The Wisteria Tree’s Leaf Prophecy" to "Dedicate Your Hearts," each designed to test analytical thinking and coding precision. The competition concluded with standout performances, as Rishi Varshney claimed the top spot, followed by Abhishek Kumar Chaurasia and Kshitij Dwivedi as first and second runners-up, respectively. HackQuest’s success reflects the enthusiasm and talent within the tech community, setting the stage for future competitions that encourage learning and excellence through friendly rivalry..</p>
