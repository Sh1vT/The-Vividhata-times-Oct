                    <p>During the <small class="circle">AR-VR IN ACTION</small> workshop, experts highlighted the
                        practical application of augmented
                        reality (AR) through tools like Snapchat's filters, known as "Lenses." These Lenses allow users
                        to overlay digital effects onto their real-world environment in real-time, transforming their
                        appearance or surroundings. Snapchat's Lens Studio is a powerful desktop application that
                        enables artists and developers to create these interactive AR experiences. With Lens Studio,
                        users can design custom Lenses, incorporating 3D objects, animations, and interactive elements,
                        which can then be shared with Snapchat's vast user base. This platform has democratized AR
                        development, allowing both novices and professionals to contribute to the growing library of
                        immersive content on Snapchat. ​</p>
